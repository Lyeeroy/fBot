Script Name: AutoIt Minecraft Fishing Bot

Description:
This AutoIt script is designed to automate fishing in Minecraft. It features a user-friendly graphical interface with real-time status updates. The script constantly scans for the presence of a red color within a specified area on the screen, simulating the fishing action when it detects the red color. It also provides runtime tracking and an easy-to-use close bind.

Requirements:

    AutoIt: The script is written in AutoIt, so you need to have AutoIt installed to run it.
    Minecraft: Ensure that Minecraft is installed and configured properly.

Installation Steps:

    Install AutoIt:
        Download AutoIt from the official website (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).
        Follow the installation instructions provided on the website to install AutoIt.

    Configure Minecraft:
        Launch Minecraft and make sure it's set up to your liking.
        Important: To ensure the script works correctly, configure your Minecraft settings so that the red color used by the script is displayed within a square on the screen. The script is designed to detect this red color for fishing.

Usage:

    Run the AutoIt script after successfully installing AutoIt.

    A graphical interface will appear, showing the status of the fishing bot.

    Minecraft must be the active window for the script to work. If it's not, the script will wait for Minecraft to become active.

    After a 4-second delay to set up Minecraft, the fishing bot will be activated, and the script will start monitoring for the red color within the specified area.

    When the script detects the red color within the defined area, it will simulate a right-click (fishing action) in Minecraft.

    The fishing bot will continue to run until you press the "ESC" key.

    The script will display the number of fish caught and the runtime in the graphical interface.

Note: Make sure your Minecraft settings are adjusted so that the red color used by the script is clearly visible within a square on the screen. Failure to do so may result in the script not detecting the fishing action.

Feel free to customize the script and the graphical interface as needed. Enjoy your automated Minecraft fishing experience!
