## Description
This AutoIt script automates fishing in Minecraft. It constantly scans for a red color within a specified area on the screen.

## Requirements
- [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/): Install AutoIt to run the script.
- Minecraft

## Installation

1. **Install AutoIt:**
   - Download [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) from the official website.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website to install AutoIt.

2. **Configure Minecraft:**
   - Launch Minecraft and make sure you have a fishing rod in your hand and are facing the water.
   - Important: Make sure you have red color inside a square on the screen. The script relies on this for fishing detection.

## Set-up

1. Run the AutoIt script after successfully installing AutoIt.

2. A GUI will appear, displaying the fishing bot's status.

3. Minecraft must be the active window for the script to function. If it's not, the script will wait for Minecraft to become active.

4. After a 4-second delay for Minecraft setup, the fishing bot will activate, and the script will begin monitoring for the red color within the specified area.

5. The fishing bot will continue running until you press the "ESC" key.

6. The graphical interface will display the number of fish caught and the runtime.

**Testing:** I ran the script for about 1 hour without stopping, and it was surprisingly 100% accurate.

**Note:** Ensure that Minecraft clearly displays the red color within a square on the screen, night can be challenging for the script, so make sure you have a torch around. F1 might help for clarity. Failure to do so may result in the script not detecting the fishing action.

Feel free to customize the script. Enjoy automated fishing in Minecraft!
